# Project_Description:
Burger Devourer is a restaurant app that lets users input the burgers or sandwiches they'd like to eat. Each entry builds a list of the burgers with a corresponding button "Devour it!" that moves the burger to a new list which designates the burger as being "devoured." 

# Usage:
 Use it to keep track of all the burgers and fancy sandwiches you've eaten. 

# Installation:
 Simply follow this link: https://agile-ocean-45821.herokuapp.com 

# Contribute:
 Go ahead and fork the repo and "dig in." 

# tests
How to test project functionality: Try adding sandwiches and devouring them.
